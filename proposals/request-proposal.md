# Improve the scis request feed

Right now SCIS Requests is a straight non-styled feed of requests. 

This makes it difficult for staff to navigate their way around this list and find the appropiate request when necessary

## Requirements

This proposal would require cooperation with SCIS in order to start this project

## Processes

Add styling and structure to the request data response raw data to make it look more appealing
